ISEGI Map - Tilemill
=================

Folks you will need to download tilemill map studio from this location - http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/

Then click releases above and download version V0.1 then you should find where your mapbox project folder is in my case:

    /Volumes/DATA/Mapbox/projects

You should then copy your the unzipped files from the download into this folder and open mapbox.

You should be presented with a screen showing all your maps - click the **ISEGI CAMPUS MAP** one

The resulting map at present may also be viewed at - http://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/rusty.map-ag30cy9j/page.html
